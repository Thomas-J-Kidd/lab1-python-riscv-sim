**Next Steps**

- Draft Requirements Document:
    - List the instructions to implement and expected outputs.
    - Define how the simulator interacts with input files and commands.
- Define Inputs/Outputs for Auto-Grading:
    - Use JSON or plain text for input/output formats to facilitate auto-grading.
    - Provide expected outputs for test cases to compare against student implementations.
- Provide Skeleton Code:
    - Include placeholders for core functionality (fetch, decode, execute).
    - Offer examples of one or two completed instructions (e.g., ADD) to guide implementation.
- Set Grading Criteria:
    - Accuracy of simulation (correct updates to registers and memory).
    - Code readability and modularity (for future labs).
    - Coverage of all required instructions.

By using these requirements as a base, the lab can be structured to give students clear objectives and a manageable workload.
